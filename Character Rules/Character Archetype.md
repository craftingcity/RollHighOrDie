# Preamble
In RHoD, each character begins as a blank slate. A list of numbers, a faint whisp of personality, or sometimes both. Beyond these differences, the matrix of possibility unfolds. A character's archetype is the range of abilities that they readily have access to and what they call themselves because of it.

As a character lives in the system of RHoD, they may gain [[Experience]]. Over time, they may spend this [[Experience]] on [[Features]] and [[Traits]] that suit their needs, wants, and circumstances.
