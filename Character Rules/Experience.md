# Preamble
Experience is the numerical representation of a character's accumulative knowledge and application of their abilities under pressure. Experience is awarded to characters as they face challenges, and is consumed as the character expands their abilities.

At the conclusion of an Encounter, each participating character will gain a number of experience based on the relative difficulty of that Encounter.

## Spending Experience
During a Full Rest, a character may spend the Experience they have gained in exchange for a number of improvements.
