# Preamble
Skills are the separate and specific areas of theoretical, practical, or applied knowledge a character may have. Where a character's Ability Scores provide a general overview of their ability or ferocity, Skills are more situationally specific.

## Proficiency
Proficiency has five Degrees, each of which represents a point in a range from 0 to 8. The Degrees of Proficiency are as follows; Untrained grants +0, Learning grants +2, Competent grants +4, Expert grants +6, and Master grants +8.

When you make a Skill Check, make an Ability Check using the Skill's Core Ability and add your Degree of Proficiency.

## Combat Skills
The following Skills are directly related to a character's performance in combat.

### Reactive Defenses
#### Reflex
> Your Reflex is equal to 8, plus your Degree of Proficiency, plus your Dexterity or Intelligence Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

#### Fortitude
> Your Fortitude is equal to 8, plus your Degree of Proficiency, Plus your Strength or Constitution Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

#### Will
> Your Will is equal to 8, plus your Degree of Proficiency, plus your Wisdom or Charisma Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

### Weaponry
Your Skill in a given Weapon Base directly affects your ability to hit with Attacks you make while using that Weapon Base.
##### Melee
#### Short Blunt
> Short Blunt weapons include items such as batons, hammers, or war clubs - instruments that can usually be held in one hand and deal a force to a single point.

#### Long Blunt
> Long Blunt weapons range from the working shovel to the military maul - implements of brute force. The long handled older sibling of the Short Blunt weapon.

#### Short Blade
> Short Blades are your shanks, shivs, and daggers. History's favorite tool.

#### Long Blade
> Long Blades are the most typical weapons of melee combat - from the shortsword to the claymore, these blades are built to protect you and yours from the opposition.

#### Axe
> Axes are a simple category of weapon, that spans the width of the humble hatchet and the glorious great axe. While an atypical weapon of war, the axe earns its place as a staple of intimidation and necessity.

#### Polearm
> Polearms are most commonly recognized as a long stick with a few pointy bits on the end. Spears, Glaives, Halberds. These polearms are each a simpler weapon on a long handle.

#### Flexible
> Flexible weapons are the least commonly used category of weapon. Whips, Chainlocks, and Flails are all examples of Flexible weapons - in the right hands, a simple strip of leather controls the battlefield.

##### Ranged
#### Sling
> Using the power of momentum, Slings fire a number of small projectiles, including scavenged pebbles, polished pellets, or even small explosives. 

#### Bow
> Using the power of elastics, Bows fire arrows at high speeds to pierce through armoring and cause significant internal damage.

#### Crossbow
> Using the power of elastics and the stability of the buttstock, Crossbows fire a smaller arrow known as a bolt at high speeds and with great accuracy.

#### Pistol
> Harnessing the mystic or the scientific, Pistols fire small projectiles at imperceptibly fast speeds, and can fire a number of projectiles before they must be reloaded.

#### Rifle
> Harnessing the mystic or the scientific, Rifles are the more militaristic older sibling of the humble Pistol, and typically shoot larger caliber ammunition.
