# Preamble
Skills are the separate and specific areas of theoretical, practical, or applied knowledge a character may have. Where a character's Ability Scores provide a general overview of their ability or ferocity, Skills are more situationally specific.

## Proficiency
Proficiency has five degrees; "Untrained", "Learning", "Competent", "Expert", and "Mastered". Each represents a point on a scale from 0 to 6,

When you make a Skill Check, make an Ability Check using the Skill's Core Ability and add your Proficiency.
