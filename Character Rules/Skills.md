# Preamble
Skills are the separate and specific areas of theoretical, practical, or applied knowledge a character may have. Where a character's Ability Scores provide a general overview of their ability or ferocity, Skills are more situationally specific.

## Proficiency
Proficiency has five Degrees, each of which represents a point in a range from 0 to 8. The Degrees of Proficiency are as follows; Untrained grants +0, Learning grants +2, Competent grants +4, Expert grants +6, and Master grants +8.

When you make a Skill Check, make an Ability Check using the Skill's Core Ability and add your Degree of Proficiency.
