# Preamble
Skills are the separate and selective areas of theoretical, practical, or applied knowledge a character may have. Where a character's Ability Scores provide a general overview of their ability or ferocity, Skills are the specific areas a character excels in.

Each Skill is backed by a given Ability Score.
