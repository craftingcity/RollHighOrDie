# Preamble
Skills are the separate and specific areas of theoretical, practical, or applied knowledge a character may have. Where a character's Ability Scores provide a general overview of their ability or ferocity, Skills are more situationally specific.

How good at a Skill a character happens to be is known as their Proficiency in that Skill.
