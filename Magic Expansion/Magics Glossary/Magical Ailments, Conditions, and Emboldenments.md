# Preamble
Conditions in RHoD are the temporary afflictions or effects that characters may experience during your game.

While [[Ailment]] and [[Emboldenment]] are imparted by one character onto another, Conditions reflect the current status of a given character.

### Conditions
#### Flux Overpressured
While you are 'Flux Overpressured', at the beginning of your turn you take a number of Radiant Damage equal to your current total Flux minus your Flux Capacity for each stack of 'Flux Overpressured' you have.

On your turn, if your current total Flux is less than your Flux Capacity, you may spend 2 AP to Manually Resolve a stack of 'Flux Overpressured'.

### Ailments
