# Preamble
A character's Defenses are the mechanical estimates of their ability to refuse or withstand damage from opponents using genuine harm against them.

## Reactive Defenses
Your three Reactive Defenses are the first line of defense against any harmful effect, including enemy attacks. These three are Reflex, Will, and Fortitude.

#### Reflex
Your character's Reflex is their ability to completely out-maneuver a direct physical attack. 

Your Reflex is equal to 8, plus your Proficiency Modifier, plus your Dexterity or Intelligence Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

#### Will
Your character's Will is their ability to withstand harmful mental effects, natural, magical, or otherwise. 

Your Will is equal to 8, plus your Proficiency Modifier, plus your Wisdom or Charisma Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

#### Fortitude
Your character's Fortitude is their ability to ignore and combat internal effects and changes.

Your Fortitude is equal to 8, plus your Proficiency Modifier, Plus your Strength or Constitution Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.


## Ablative Defenses
Your two Ablative Defenses are the final line of defense against harmful effects, and when your Armoring and Vitality are reduced to zero and then below, you will quickly become welcomed to your final rest.

#### Armoring
When you take damage you will take the damage to your Armoring before your Vitality. Before you begin to reduce your Vitality, you must completely reduce your Armoring to 0.

If you take damage that would reduce your Armoring to less than 0, instead, it reduces it to 0 and you reduce your Vitality by the remaining amount.

Your character's Armoring will depend on your currently worn Equipment.

###### Damage Resistance (DR)
While you have more than 0 Armoring, you reduce any damage you would by your current Damage Resistance total.

###### True Damage
There are times a character will take damage despite the condition of their Armoring. This damage is known as True Damage. When a character takes True Damage, they treat their Armoring as 0 when taking that damage.

#### Vitality
When your Armoring has been reduced to 0, you will begin to take damage to your Vitality instead. If you would take damage that reduces your Vitality to less than 0, instead, you incur a Wound, expend a Hit Die, and regain the number rolled plus your Constitution Modifier as Vitality.

At the beginning of your turn, and whenever you take a Wound, if you have more Wounds than the value of your Constitution Modifier, immediately make a Death Call.

###### Hit Die & Recovering Vitality
You have a number of Hit Die equal to your TMK. Unless otherwise stated, these Hit Die are d6's. While you are not in an Encounter, you may expend any numb

###### Death Call
When you make a Death Call, you are as far from control as you can be, and you will grow farther from it as your character continues to die.

To make a Death call, roll a d20. Do not add any modifiers or values.

If the result is 10 or greater, you succeed, and fail to die for just a little longer.

If the result is 9 or less, you fail, and you gain a stack of the 'Exhausted' [[Condition]]. When you gain your 6th stack of 'Exhausted', you die.
