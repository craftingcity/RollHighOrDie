# Preamble
Ability Scores are the numerical representation of a character's base ability to enact their desires within or upon the world. There are six Ability Scores in RHoD, which can be split into physical scores - [[#Strength]], [[#Dexterity]], [[#Constitution]] - and mental scores - [[#Intelligence]], [[#Wisdom]], [[#Charisma]].

## Ability Checks
While a character's ability is tested, and the result is uncertain, they make an Ability Check. To make an Ability Check, roll a d20, and add the relevant Ability Modifier to the total.
