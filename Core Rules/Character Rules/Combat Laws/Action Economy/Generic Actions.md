# Preamble
While most Actions a character will use throughout a game of RHoD come from their chosen [[Features]] and/or [[Traits]], the following Actions are available to most if not all characters in the world of RHoD.

## Aid
###### 1AP
'You provide assistance to an ally, increasing their chances of success.'

Target a willing creature within 5ft of you. You provide them with the 'Aided' [[Emboldenment]] as you move to assist them on their next action.

Taking this action will end your turn.

## Attack
###### 1AP
'You attack your opposition with a weapon and the intention to damage them into compliance. Or destruction.'

Target a creature within your Weapon Range and establish Line of Sight. Make an Attack Roll by making an Ability Check using your Weapon's Attack Ability, then adding your Proficiency Modifier. This is your Attack Roll Total.

Compare your Attack Roll Total to your target's Relevant Defense for your Weapon. If your Total is greater or equal to the target's Defense, you've "hit". 

When you "hit", roll your Weapon Damage and add your Weapon Damage Modifier. The target of your Attack takes that much damage.

## Maneuver
###### 1AP

## Detect
###### 1AP
'You take a moment to scan your surroundings, identifying hidden threats and relevant information within the area.'

Make a Wisdom (Perception) Ability Check. Any creatures in the area under the 'Hidden' [[Condition]] must make a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check equal or greater than your total, or they are no longer 'Hidden'.

## Interact
###### 0AP
