# Preamble
A number of positions and circumstances during combat will effect the outcome of that combat - who lives and who dies. The following sections will discuss the rules and definitions of how any combat generally operates.

## Timing

## Positioning
While you are in combat, RHoD assumes your character will occupy a 5ft square at any given time. 

You may not end your turn occupying the same space as any other creature. You may pass through a space occupied by an ally without penalty, but you may not pass through a space occupied by someone who considers you hostile.

#### Line of Sight
When you make an Attack, you must first establish Line of Sight with your target. This requires that a point within the space your character occupies and a point on the space your target occupies may be connected by a straight and unbroken line. Your Line of Sight may "pass through" spaces or barriers defined as High Cover or Low Cover.

#### High Ground
When you make an attack, if the space you occupy is above the space your target occupies, you gain +5 to that attack.

#### Environmental Damage
When a character is pushed, if they are pushed into an object or wall they cannot pass through, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 5ft they cannot be pushed.

## Stance & Cover
### Stances
Stance is the way your character's body is positioned, and will affect how effectively you fight. The four stances RHoD mechanically cares for are High Ready, Low Ready, Crouched, and Prone. 

###### High Ready
High Ready is an upright position, where your character has their weapon in a forward battle-ready position. You are favoring offence in this stance.

While you are in the High Ready Stance, you have +1 on Initiative Rolls and a +2 to Attack Rolls.

###### Low Ready
Low Ready is an upright position, where your character has their weapon in a lowered position. While you maintain your readiness for battle, you are favoring your maneuverability in this stance.

While you are in the Low Ready Stance, you have +2 on Stealth Rolls and a +1 to your Reflex Defense.

###### Crouched
Crouched is a lowered position, where your character has lowered themselves at the knees or hips. This stance is favorable for Ranged combatants, who experience a more consistent aiming experience, but it can be detrimental for those combatants who rely on mobility and martial prowess.

While you are in the Crouched Stance, you cannot run, you gain a +3 bonus to Ranged Attacks, and you treat Low Cover as High Cover.

###### Prone
Prone is a fully lowered position, where your character has their chest or back upon the ground. This stance is rarely favorable for any combatant, and likely should be reserved for taking "deep" cover.

While you are in the Prone Stance, you cannot run, you treat Low Cover as High Cover, and No Cover as Low Cover. Attacks against you that originate within 10' have Advantage.

### Cover
Cover is any barrier between you and your opposition. Taking effective Cover during combat is a life-saving strategy.

###### Full Cover
You are adjacent to Full Cover, such as a stone wall. You do not have Line of Sight through or over your Cover. Creatures on the other side of your Cover do not have Line of Sight on you.

###### High Cover
You are adjacent to High Cover, such as a wooden wall. You do not have Line of Sight through or over your Cover. When you are the target of a Ranged Attack by an creature on the other side of your Cover, you impose -6 to hit on that attack.

###### Low Cover
You are adjacent to Low Cover, such as a mid-sized crate. You have Line of Sight through or over your Cover. When you are the target of a Ranged Attack by an creature on the other side of your Cover, you impose -3 to hit on that attack.

###### No Cover
You are not adjacent to any cover.
