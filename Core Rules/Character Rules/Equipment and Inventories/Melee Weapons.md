# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of weapons. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's weapons are a Base and a collection of Tags.

Given this, weapons can be mutable while you are playing - you may replace, gain, or remove Tags from your Base weapon - so long as your character has the knowledge and makes the effort, they can change may aspects of their weapon.

## Tags
### Required Tags

Some Tags are considered "inherent". This means that changing that Tag may involve recategorizing the weapon under a different Base, according to your Referee's discretion.

Short Blunt and Short Blade Weapons inherently are Small.

Long Blunt and Long Blade Weapons inherently are Medium or Large.

#### Range

Short Blunt and Short Blade Weapons inherently have a range of 5ft.

Polearms inherently have a range of 10ft.
