# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of weapons. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's weapons are a Base and a collection of Tags.

Given this, weapons can be mutable while you are playing - you may replace, gain, or remove Tags from your Base weapon - so long as your character has the knowledge and makes the effort, they can change may aspects of their weapon.

## Tags
### Required Tags
All Weapons must have the following Tags, as each is mechanically relevant.

Some Tags are considered "inherent". This means that changing that Tag may involve recategorizing the weapon under a different Base, according to your Referee's discretion. 

#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the weapon - Small, Medium, or Large - and is only used for inventory management. 

Short Blunt and Short Blade Weapons inherently are Small.

Long Blunt and Long Blade Weapons inherently are Medium or Large.

#### Range
This is the mechanical Range of the weapon.

Short Blunt and Short Blade Weapons inherently have a range of 5ft.

Polearms inherently have a range of 10ft.

#### Weapon Ability
This is the Ability Score relevant to hitting and dealing damage with this weapon - either Strength or Dexterity. No other Ability Scores are relevant in this regard.

This Tag is immutable, and cannot be changed.

#### Relevant Defense
This is the Defense that the Weapon targets to determine hit or miss during a Generic Attack. The vast majority of Weapons target Reflex.

#### Ammunition (X)
This is the Maximum Capacity of Ammunition for this Weapon. 

When you take an Attack with this Weapon, you spend one of this Weapon's Loaded Ammunition. If this Weapon's Loaded Ammunition is 0, you must Reload before you can make an Attack with this Weapon.

### Mundane Tags
#### Quick
While this Weapon is Equipped, in either hand, or Sheathed, you gain +1 to Initiative Rolls.

You do not incur Disadvantage when making Ranged Attacks with this weapon while a hostile creature is within 5'.
