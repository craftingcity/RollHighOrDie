# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of weapons. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's weapons are a Base and a collection of Tags.

Given this, weapons can be mutable while you are playing - you may replace, gain, or remove Tags from your Base weapon - so long as your character has the knowledge, materials, and time, they can change may aspects of their weapon.

## Tags
### Required Tags
All Weapons must have the following Tags, as each is mechanically relevant.

Some Tags are considered "inherent". This means that changing that Tag may involve recategorizing the weapon under a different Base, according to your Referee's discretion. 

#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the weapon - Small, Medium, or Large - and is used to determine the AP cost of Attacking with the Weapon.

Small Weapons cost 2 AP to Attack with.

Medium Weapons cost 3 AP to Attack with.

Large Weapons cost 4 AP to Attack with.

Sling and Pistol Weapons are inherently Small.

Bow, Crossbow, and Rifle Weapons are inherently Medium or Large.

#### Range
This is the mechanical Range of the weapon. The first value indicated is the Range beyond which targe
