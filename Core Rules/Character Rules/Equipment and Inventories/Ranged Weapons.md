# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of weapons. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's weapons are a Base and a collection of Tags.

Given this, weapons can be mutable while you are playing - you may replace, gain, or remove Tags from your Base weapon - so long as your character has the knowledge and makes the effort, they can change may aspects of their weapon.
