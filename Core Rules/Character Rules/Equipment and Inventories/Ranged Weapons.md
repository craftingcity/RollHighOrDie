# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of weapons. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's weapons are a Base and a collection of Tags.

Given this, weapons can be mutable while you are playing - you may replace, gain, or remove Tags from your Base weapon - so long as your character has the knowledge, materials, and time, they can change may aspects of their weapon.

## Bases
#### Sling
Using the power of momentum, Slings fire a number of small projectiles, including scavenged pebbles, polished pellets, or even small explosives. 

#### Bow
Using the power of elastics, Bows fire arrows at high speeds to pierce through armoring and cause significant internal damage.

#### Crossbow
Using the power of elastics and the stability of the buttstock, Crossbows fire a smaller arrow known as a bolt at high speeds and with great accuracy.

#### Pistol
Harnessing the mystic or the scientific, Pistols fire small projectiles at imperceptibly fast speeds, and can fire a number of projectiles before they must be reloaded.

#### Rifle
Harnessing the mystic or the scientific, Rifles are the older, more militaristic older sibling of the humble Pistol, and typically shoot larger caliber ammunition.

## Tags
### Required Tags
All Weapons must have the following Tags, as each is mechanically relevant.

Some Tags are considered "inherent". This means that changing that Tag may involve recategorizing the weapon under a different Base, according to your Referee's discretion. 

#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the weapon - Small, Medium, or Large - and is used to determine the AP cost of Attacking with the Weapon.

Small Weapons cost 2 AP to Attack with.

Medium Weapons cost 3 AP to Attack with.

Large Weapons cost 4 AP to Attack with.

Sling and Pistol Weapons are inherently Small.

Bow, Crossbow, and Rifle Weapons are inherently Medium or Large.

#### Range
This is the mechanical Range of the weapon. The first value indicated is the Normal Range. The second value indicated is the Maximum Range.

When you make an Attack at a target beyond your Normal Range, you make the Attack with Disadvantage.

You cannot make Attacks at targets beyond your Maximum Range.

#### Weapon Ability
This is the Ability Score relevant to hitting and dealing damage with this weapon - either Strength or Dexterity. No other Ability Scores are relevant in this regard.

This Tag is immutable, and cannot be changed.

#### Relevant Defense
This is the Defense that the Weapon targets to determine hit or miss during a Generic Attack. The vast majority of Weapons target Reflex.

#### Capacity (X)
This is the Maximum Capacity of Ammunition for this Weapon. 

When you take an Attack with this Weapon, you spend one of this Weapon's Loaded Ammunition. If this Weapon's Loaded Ammunition is 0, you must Reload before you can make an Attack with this Weapon.

If there is no value indicated, your weapon has no capacity to hold Loaded Ammunition, and each shot is loaded as a part of your Attacks with this weapon.

### Mundane Tags
#### Quick
While this Weapon is Equipped, in either hand, or Sheathed, you gain +1 to Initiative Rolls.

You do not incur Disadvantage when making Ranged Attacks with this weapon while a hostile creature is within 5'.

#### Versatile (yDx / +Z)
This Weapon is designed to be used in one or both hands. When wielded on both hands, this Weapon's Damage Dice increases to the value (y) and type (x) indicated or you gain the value indicated (+Z) when making Attack Rolls with this Weapon.

#### Two-Handed
This Weapon must be used in both hands.
