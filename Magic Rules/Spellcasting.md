# Preamble
The ability to manipulate reality on a personal whim is known as "Magic", and the induvial manipulations are known as "Spells". The people or entities that can perform this "Magic" are known as "Spellcasters".

Magic is an inherently setting-shaping concept, and does not necessarily appear in the setting of your game. The rules provided here describe magic's mechanical consequences

## Understanding Spells
Spells simply are the combination of a desired effect and magical effort. Some Spellcasters collect Defined Spells for their own use, while others gather potential Spell Effects and create unique Spells in and for the moment they need them.

###### Spell Effects
Spell Effects are the resulting truth of reality when a Spell is cast. Spellcasters use Spell Effects to create and cast Spells.

Spell Effects determine the costs and effects of a Spell.

###### Defined Spells
Defined Spells are the result of knowledge and effort on the part of a proficient Spellcaster to create a Spell and spread it among the greater magical community.

Using Defined Spells is typically safer and more efficient than creating unique Spells due to their communal nature, however, they create specific replicable effects that might not completely fulfill the needs of the moment.

###### Techniques
In the context of Magic, Techniques are groups of Defined Spells or Spell Effects. Often, a Spellcaster will have access to multiple Techniques while specializing in a select few. Techniques are first categorized by complexity, one of Basic, Complex, or Epic, and then by Power Source.

## Costs of Spellcasting
The manner in which you pay for a Spell's costs depend on the Feature that granted you the ability to cast Spells.

###### Succeeding in Arcane Casting
When you attempt to cast Spells using 'Innate Spellcasting' or 'Learned Spellcasting', you gain the Spell's Effort Cost as Flux. When you gain Flux, if your current total Flux is greater than your Flux Capacity, you gain a stack of the 'Flux Overpressure' [[Condition]].

When you cast a Defined Spell, make a Static Casting Skill Check.

When you cast a Spell you have completed with Spell Effects, make a  Skill Check.

If the result is equal or greater than the Spell's Complexity, you succeed in casting the Spell. If the result is less than the Spell's Complexity, it fails, and you gain a stack of the 'Flux Overpressure' [[Condition]].

###### Reducing Flux
The Flux you gain while casting spells will dissipate over time at rest.

While you are not in an Encounter, your current total Flux is reduced by 3 for every hour 

###### Succeeding in Divine Casting
When you attempt Spells using 'Divine Spellcasting' or 'Pact Spellcasting', you expend the Spell's Effort Cost as Piety. You cannot expend Piety you do not have.

###### Increasing Piety
