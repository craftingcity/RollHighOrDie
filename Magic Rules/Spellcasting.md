# Preamble
The ability to manipulate reality on a personal whim is known as "Magic", and the induvial manipulations are known as "Spells". The people or entities that can perform this "Magic" are known as "Spellcasters".

Magic is an inherently setting-shaping concept. The rules provided here describe a version of magic's mechanical consequences, should it appear in your game.

## Understanding Spells
Spells simply are the combination of a desired effect and magical effort. Some Spellcasters collect Defined Spells for their own use, while others gather potential Spell Effects and create unique Spells in and for the moment they need them.

###### Spell Effects
Spell Effects are the resulting truth of reality when a Spell is cast. Spellcasters use Spell Effects to create and cast Spells.

Spell Effects determine the costs and effects of a Spell.

###### Defined Spells
Defined Spells are the result of knowledge and effort on the part of a proficient Spellcaster to create a Spell and spread it among the greater magical community.

Using Defined Spells is typically safer and more efficient than creating unique Spells due to their communal nature, however, they create specific replicable effects that might not completely fulfill the needs of the moment.

###### Techniques
In the context of Magic, Techniques are groups of Defined Spells or Spell Effects. Often, a Spellcaster will have access to multiple Techniques while specializing in a select few. Techniques are first categorized by complexity, one of Basic, Complex, or Epic, and then by Power Source.

## Costs of Spellcasting
The manner in which you pay for a Spell's costs depend on the Feature that granted you the ability to cast Spells.

#### Succeeding in Arcane Casting
When you attempt to cast Spells using 'Innate Spellcasting' or 'Learned Spellcasting', you gain the Spell's Effort Cost as Flux. When you gain Flux, if your current total Flux is greater than your Flux Capacity, you gain a stack of the 'Flux Overpressure' [[Condition]].

Then, if you are casting a Defined Spell, make a Static Casting Skill Check, or if you are casting a Spell you have constructed using Spell Effects, make a Fluid Casting Skill Check.

If the result is equal to or greater than the Spell's Complexity, you succeed in casting the Spell. If the result is less than the Spell's Complexity, it fails, and you gain a stack of the 'Flux Overpressure' [[Condition]].

###### Step-by-Step

	1. Choose or Construct a spell to cast.
	2. Expend Action Points equal to the spell's Speed.
	3. Gain Flux equal to the spell's Effort.
	4. Make a Static Casting or Fluid Casting Check against the spell's Complexity.
	5. Declare Targets.
	6. Resolve Effects.

###### Reducing Flux
The Flux you gain while casting spells will dissipate over time at rest.

While you are not in an Encounter, you may expend any number of Hit Die you have to reduce your current total Flux. When you expend a Hit Die this way, you reduce your Flux by a value equal to half the number rolled plus your Constitution Modifier.

#### Succeeding in Divine Casting
When you attempt Spells using 'Divine Spellcasting' or 'Pact Spellcasting', you expend the Spell's Effort Cost as Piety. You cannot expend Piety you do not have.

###### Increasing Piety
You can increase your Piety by performing actions for the favor of your patron. The following list provides examples of ideologically favorable actions and their corresponding Piety value.

| P.V. | Favorable Action                        | Ideo.       |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| +1   | Uphold moral law.                       | Lawful      |
| +1   | Punish wrongdoing.                      | Good        |
| +1   | Break moral law.                        | Chaos       |
| +1   | Conduct wrongdoing.                     | Evil        |
| +2   | Execute an immoral entity.              | Lawful/Good |
| +2   | Execute a moral innocent.               | Chaos/Evil  |
| +2   | Participate in community assembly.      | Lawful/Good |
| +2   | Destroy significant community property. | Chaos/Evil  |
| +2   | Spare the surrendered.                  | Lawful      |
| +2   | Execute the surrendered.                | Chaos       |

## Constructing Spells
At any time, your character can mentally construct unique Spells using the Spell Effects they have learned through their Techniques.

A Spell's Base determines a number of core feature of casting a given spell, including whether or not Line of Sight and or a second "accuracy" Casting Skill Check are required, and how it does or does not interact with the space in between yourself and your target.

After you have selected a Spell Base, you may choose any number of Spell Effects you know as the effects of the Spell. As you do, the Spell Effects you choose will add to the Spell's total Complexity and or Effort. You will use these total values when you are Casting this Spell.
