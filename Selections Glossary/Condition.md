# Preamble
Conditions in RHoD are the temporary afflictions or effects that characters may experience during your game.

While [[Ailment]] and [[Emboldenment]] are imparted by one character onto another, Conditions reflect the current status of a given character.

## Resolving Conditions
Some Conditions will Naturally Resolve over time, while others will persist, and require action to Magically Resolve or Chemically Resolve.

After a Condition has Resolved, you are no longer under it's effects.
