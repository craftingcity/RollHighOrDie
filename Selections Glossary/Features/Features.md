# Preamble
Features are the abilities that characters gain throughout their time under the spotlight of your game. Features are typically active abilities, and have Action Point requirements. Some Features have Prerequisites that you must meet or surpass before you are eligible to take that feature.

For ease of presentation, Features are categorized by their "source of power" and requirements.

- [[Features - Arcane]]
- [[Features - Divine]]
- [[Features - Martial]]

#### Inherit and Replace
When one Feature "inherits and replaces" another, the first Feature gains all text, properties, and effects of the requirement Feature, effectively acting as the requirement Feature plus the new text of the first Feature.
