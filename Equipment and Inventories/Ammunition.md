### Required Tags
#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the Ammunition. All Ammunition is 'stackable' to the value indicated after their Size - either Small or Tiny.

#### Ammunition Damage Dice
This is the amount (y) and type (x) of dice you will roll to deal damage with this Ammunition.

#### Ammunition Damage Type
This is the type of damage that the Weapon deals. Mundane Weapons only ever deal Piercing, Bludgeoning, and/or Slashing damage.
