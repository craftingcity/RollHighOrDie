# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of weapons. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's weapons are a Base and a collection of Tags.

Given this, weapons can be mutable while you are playing - you may replace, gain, or remove Tags from your Base weapon - so long as your character has the knowledge materials, and time, they can change may aspects of their weapon.

A character's ability to hit on Attacks with a given Weapon is directly related to a character's [[Ability Scores]] and Combat [[Skills]].

## Bases
#### Short Blunt
Short Blunt weapons include items such as batons, hammers, or war clubs - instruments that can usually be held in one hand and deal a force to a single point.

#### Long Blunt
Long Blunt weapons range from the working shovel to the military maul - implements of brute force. The long handled older sibling of the Short Blunt weapon.

#### Short Blade
Short Blades are your shanks, shivs, and daggers. History's favorite tool.

#### Long Blade
Long Blades are the most typical weapons of melee combat - from the shortsword to the claymore, these blades are built to protect you and yours from the opposition.

#### Axe
Axes are a simple category of weapon, that spans the width of the humble hatchet and the glorious great axe. While an atypical weapon of war, the axe earns its place as a staple of intimidation and necessity.

#### Polearm
Polearms are most commonly recognized as a long stick with a few pointy bits on the end. Spears, Glaives, Halberds. These polearms are each a simple weapon on a longer handle.

#### Flexible
Flexible weapons are the least commonly used category of weapon. Whips, Chainlocks, and Flails are all examples of Flexible weapons - in the right hands, a simple strip of leather controls the battlefield.

## Tags
### Required Tags
All Weapons must have the following Tags, as each is mechanically relevant.

Some Tags are considered "inherent". This means that changing that Tag may involve recategorizing the weapon under a different Base, according to your Referee's discretion. 

#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the weapon - Small, Medium, or Large - and is used to determine the AP cost of Attacking with the Weapon.

Small Weapons cost 2 AP to Attack with.

Medium Weapons cost 3 AP to Attack with.

Large Weapons cost 4 AP to Attack with.

Short Blunt and Short Blade Weapons inherently are Small.

Long Blunt, Long Blade, Axe, and Polearm Weapons inherently are Medium or Large.

#### Range
This is the mechanical Range of the weapon.

Short Blunt and Short Blade Weapons inherently have a range of 5ft.

Polearms inherently have a range of 10ft.

#### Weapon Ability
This is the Ability Score relevant to hitting and dealing damage with this weapon - either Strength or Dexterity. No other Ability Scores are relevant in this regard.

This Tag is immutable, and cannot be changed.

#### Relevant Defense
This is the Defense that the Weapon targets to determine hit or miss during a Generic Attack. The vast majority of Weapons target Reflex.

#### Weapon Damage Dice (yDx)
This is the amount (y) and type (x) of dice you will roll to deal damage with this Weapon.

#### Weapon Damage Type
This is the type of damage that the Weapon deals. Mundane Weapons only ever deal Piercing, Bludgeoning, and/or Slashing damage.

### Mundane Tags
#### Light
You may choose Strength or Dexterity as this Weapon's Ability.

For W AP, you may throw this weapon. Target a creature within 30', and establish Line of Sight. Make an Attack Roll with Disadvantage against that target's Reflex.

You do not incur Disadvantage when making Ranged Attacks with this weapon while a hostile creature is within 5'.

#### Versatile (yDx / +Z)

#### Two-Handed
This Weapon must be used in both hands.

#### Unwieldy
When you use this Weapon to Attack a creature within 5' of you, you make that Attack at Disadvantage.

#### Throwable
This Weapon is designed to be throwable.

For W AP, you may throw this weapon. Target a creature within 30', and establish Line of Sight. Make an Attack Roll against that target's Reflex.

If you hit, you deal your Weapon Damage as normal.

### Specialized Tags
#### Barbed / Serrated
When you deal Damage with this Weapon, you apply one stack of the 'Bleeding' [[Condition]].
