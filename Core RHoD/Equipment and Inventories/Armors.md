# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of Armors. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's Armors are a collection of Tags.

A character's [[Defenses#Armoring]] is directly related to the Armor they are wearing in their Armor Worn Inventory Slot.

# Armor Tags
### Required Tags
#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the Armor - Small, Medium, or Large - and is used in addition to the Armor's 'Material' and 'Style' to determine the total Armoring Value of the Armor.

Small Armors have a Size Multiplier of 1.

Medium Armors have a Size Multiplier of 2.

Large Armors have a Size Multiplier of 3.

#### Material
This is the material the Armor is mostly composed of. It is used in addition to the Armor's 'Size' and 'Style' to determine the total Armoring Value of the Armor. 

##### Example Materials
| Material          | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Padded Cloth      | 1     |
| Beast Hide        | 2     |
| Tanned Leather    | 3     |
| Kevlar            | 4     |
| Bronze Chainmail  | 5     |
| Bronze Plate      | 6     |
| Steel Chainmail   | 6     |
| Steel Plate       | 8     |
| Ceramic Composite | 9     |
| Elvenfiber        | 7     |
| Darksteel Plate   | 10    |
| Mythril Plate     | 12    |
| Adamantine Plate  | 16    |

#### Style
This is the style of Armor, reflecting the Armor's Areas of Coverage, and is used in addition to the Armor's 'Material' and 'Size' to determine the total Armoring Value of the Armor.

The Style's Total Coverage Value is the total of all Coverage Values of the Style's Areas of Coverage. Areas of Coverage have a Coverage Value ranging from 1 to 3 (for example, Feet have 1CV, Front has 2CV, and Suit has 3CV). 

##### Example Styles
| Style           | Coverage Value | Areas of Coverage                                                     |

#### Armoring Value
This is the total value of Armoring this Armor provides. This value is equal to the Material Value plus the Coverage Value, multiplied by the Size Multiplier. 

Armoring = (Material Value + Coverage Value) * Size Multiplier

` current example numbers give ~700 as MaxArmoring `

> For example, let's examine a Steel Plate Full-suit Armor as made for a traditional human - Medium sized.
> Medium Armors have a SM of 2. Steel Plate has a MV of 8. Full-suit Armor has a CV of 15.
> Material Value (8) + Coverage Value (15) = 23
> 23 * Size Multiplier (2) = 46
> Medium Size Steel Plate Full-suit Armor has a total Armoring Value of 46.

### Mundane Tags
#### Padded (x)
While your Armoring is greater than 0, you have Bludgeoning Damage Resistance and Electric Damage Resistance equal to the value indicated (x) and you have Slashing Damage Vulnerability and Fire Damage Vulnerability equal to the value indicated (x).

#### Restricting (x)
While you are wearing this Armor, your Dexterity Ability Score is reduced by the indicated value (x).
