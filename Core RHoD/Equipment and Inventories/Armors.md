# Preamble
Within the fiction of the story you tell, your characters may use any number of Armors. For the purpose of mechanical potential, RHoD's Armors are a collection of Tags.

A character's [[Defenses#Armoring]] is directly related to the Armor they are wearing in one of their 'Equipment' Slots.

# Armor Tags
### Required Tags
#### Size
This is the mechanical Size of the Armor - Small, Medium, or Large - and is used in addition to the Armor's 'Material' and 'Style' to determine the total Armoring Value of the Armor.

Small Armors have a Size Multiplier of 1.

Medium Armors have a Size Multiplier of 2.

Large Armors have a Size Multiplier of 3.

#### Material
This is the material the Armor is mostly composed of. It is used in addition to the Armor's 'Size' and 'Style' to determine the total Armoring Value of the Armor.

Materials are considered either 'Light' or 'Heavy', which will determine the Armor's eligibility for use with some Features or Traits and some other Armor Tags.

##### Example Materials
| Material          | Value | L/H   |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Padded Cloth      | 1     | Light |
| Beast Hide        | 2     | Light |
| Tanned Leather    | 3     | Light |
| Kevlar            | 4     | Light |
| Bronze Chainmail  | 5     | Heavy |
| Bronze Plate      | 6     | Heavy |
| Steel Chainmail   | 6     | Heavy |
| Steel Plate       | 8     | Heavy |
| Ceramic Composite | 9     | Heavy |
| Elvenfiber        | 7     | Light |
| Darksteel Plate   | 10    | Heavy |
| Mythril Plate     | 12    | Heavy |
| Adamantine Plate  | 16    | Heavy |

#### Style
This is the style of Armor, reflecting the Armor's 'Areas of Coverage', and is used in addition to the Armor's 'Material' and 'Size' to determine the total Armoring Value of the Armor.

'Areas of Coverage' are the areas of the Armor that are actually being defended by the 'Material' of this 'Style' of Armor. 

The Style's Total Coverage Value is the total of all Coverage Values of the Style's Areas of Coverage. Areas of Coverage have a Coverage Value ranging from 1 to 3 (for example, Feet have 1CV, Arms has 2CV, and Suit has 3CV). The following table describes the 'Areas of Coverage' an Armor may have, and their respective Coverage Value.

| Area of Coverage     | Coverage Value | Description                             |

#### Armoring Value
This is the total value of Armoring this Armor provides. This value is equal to the Material Value plus the Coverage Value, multiplied by the Size Multiplier. 

Armoring = (Material Value + Coverage Value) * Size Multiplier

` current example numbers give ~700 as MaxArmoring `

> For example, let's examine a Steel Plate Full-suit Armor as made for a traditional human - Medium sized.
> Medium Armors have a SM of 2. Steel Plate has a MV of 8. Full-suit Armor has a CV of 17.
> Material Value (8) + Coverage Value (15) = 25
> 23 * Size Multiplier (2) = 50
> Medium Size Steel Plate Full-suit Armor has a total Armoring Value of 50.

### Mundane Tags
#### Padded (x)

#### Restricting (x)
While you are wearing this Armor, your Dexterity Ability Score is reduced by the indicated value (x).

### Specialized Tags
#### Powered (x)
While you are Resting, you may Fuel your Armor by expending the indicated number and type (x) of items. If you do, your Armor is Fueled for one Day.

If your Armor is not Fueled, you treat this Armor as if it had no other Mundane or Specialized Tags.
