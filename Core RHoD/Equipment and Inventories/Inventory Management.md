# Preamble
In the world of RHoD, finding a way to take home your newfound wealth may be just as much of a problem as fighting off it's previous owners. Any and all items, especially your [[Equipment]], must be stored with you if you wish to access them later.

## Slot Management
Items are always stored or held in Inventory Slots. Items are separated into four descending size categories based on weight; Large (>75lb), Medium (~10-5lb), Small (~5-1lbs), and Tiny (>1lb). Only one item or stack of items may be stored in a single Inventory Slot at a time.

```
Inventory Slots may be used to store Items of smaller size categories:
- One Large Slot can be used as three Medium Slots. 
- One Medium can be used as four Small Slots. 
- One Small slot can be used as three Tiny Slots.
```

#### Item Stacks
Some items should be contained together for ease of access and use, and are light enough that this is a possibility. These items are considered 'stackable' and will have a number after their Size that indicates that maximum number of these items that can fit together in one stack. Once this number is exceeded, excess items must be stored in another stack in a different Slot.

#### Character Inventory
Every character in RHoD is given four 'Equipment' Slots under the assumption that items stored in these Slots are being carried, worn, or held. In addition to these 'Equipment' Slots, a character gains a number of 'Strength Based' slots equal to their Strength Modifier.

Characters who are considered Large gain an effective +3 to their Strength Modifier and characters who are considered Small incur an effective -3 to their Strength Modifier for calculating the number of 'Strength Based' Inventory Slots a character receives.


```
The slots given are as follows;
	- Armor Worn (Large)
	- Headgear (Medium)
	- Main Hand (Medium)
	- Off Hand (Medium)
		- Two-Hands (Large)
	- Sheath (Medium)
	- Coinpurse (Small)
	- Quiver (Small)
```


#### Containers
Containers are considered Equipment and must be stored in a character's Inventory Slots while it is on their person, but allow a character to bend the "one item to slot" rule in their favor. A Container has a number of Slots as indicated in it's description. 

Items stored in 'Container' Slots cannot be accessed without first performing the 'UNPACK' Interact Action.

'Container' Slots may have restrictions on the Size or Type of Item stored within it, as defined in it's description.
