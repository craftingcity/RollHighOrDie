# Preamble
In the game of RHoD, a character's Equipment are their second avenue of versatility, allowing characters to soften their weaknesses and capitalize on their strengths. While most any item could be used by "thinking outside the box", Equipment *additionally* has a designed purpose represented by it's defined mechanical effect.

For ease of access and presentation, [[Armors]], [[Ammunition]], [[Melee Weapons]], and [[Ranged Weapons]] are more explicitly explained later.

## Using Equipment
To use Equipment, a character will take a number of Interact Actions to manipulate the Equipment into activating it's mechanical effect. A character must have at least one Hand free to use Equipment.

These Interact Actions are totaled and listed as the Equipment's Action Cost, which is the total number of Action Points a character spends manipulating the equipment into it's activated state, assuming it is not stored in your Main or Off Hands.

## Example Equipment
### Consumables
#### Antitoxin
### Gear
### Lights
### Traps & Throwables
#### Vial of Sulfuric Acid
Tiny, 3 Action Cost (UNPACK > HOLD > THROW/SPLASH)

THROW: You throw the vial at a Target within 30 feet of you that you can see. Make a Throw Skill Check. If the result is equal to or greater than your Target's Reflex Defense, they take 3d4 Acid Damage.

SPLASH: You splash the contents of the vial onto a Target adjacent to you that you can see. Make a Throw Skill Check. If the result is equal to or greater than your Target's Reflex Defense, they take 3d4 Acid Damage.
