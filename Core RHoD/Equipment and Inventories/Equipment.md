# Preamble
In the game of RHoD, a character's Equipment are their second avenue of versatility, allowing characters to soften their weaknesses and capitalize on their strengths. While most any item could be used by "thinking outside the box", Equipment *additionally* has a designed purpose represented by it's defined mechanical effect.

For ease of access and presentation, [[Armors]], [[Ammunition]], [[Melee Weapons]], and [[Ranged Weapons]] are more explicitly explained later.

## Using Equipment
To use Equipment, a character will take a number of Interact Actions to manipulate the Equipment into activating it's mechanical effect. The Interact Actions required are totaled and listed as the Equipment's Action Cost. 

A character must have at least one Hand free to use Equipment - if you are holding something in your hand, you must take an Interact Action to sheath or stow it before using the equipment. 

If a character cannot fully pay for the Action Cost to activate an equipment, they may take as many Interact Actions as they can in preparation for their next turn, when they can continue taking Interact Actions to complete the activation.
