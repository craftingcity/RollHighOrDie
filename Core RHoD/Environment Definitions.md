# Preamble
All things are effected by their environment, your Characters especially so. The following sections discuss the specific rules that apply in a given space within an environment.

### Rules for Environments
## Lighting
Lighting is generally a requirement for any creature to have confidence in their bodily actions. During Combat, Lighting can become a powerful weapon when used effectively.

If a space would be lit by multiple sources, it is considered lit by the brightest available light.

###### Blinding Light
Blinding Light is too much light, even through squinted eyes. Typically, Blinding Light is emitted by militaristic sources or intense natural sources.

While you are in a space lit by Blinging Light, you gain the 'Blinded' [[Ailment]] and you cannot be under the 'Hidden' [[Condition]] until you are no longer in a space lit by Blinging Light.

###### High Light
High Light is bright, but not blinding. High Light is emitted by sources like the sun, a campfire, or an electric or arcane lamp.

High Light has no mechanical benefits or deficits.

###### Low Light
Low Light enough Light to see generalities, but not details. Typically, Low Light is emitted by small sources, such as candles, or present at the edge of High Light.

While you are in a space lit by Low Light, you have Advantage on Stealth, Thievery, and Intimidation Skill Checks, and you have Disadvantage on Manipulation, Perception, and Investigation Skill Checks.

###### Darkness
Darkness is little to no light, where you cannot reasonably be certain of what you are seeing.

While you are in a space lit by Darkness, you have Advantage on Stealth, Thievery, and Intimidation Skill Checks, and you have Disadvantage on Manipulation, Perception, and Investigation Skill Checks. In addition, you impose Disadvantage on Attacks against you.

## Terrain
Terrain is the ground we walk through and upon. Mechanically, each space of an environment is defined as at least one of the following types of Terrain.

#### Solid Terrain
Solid Terrain can be walked upon, and not through. Solid Terrain is used as the floors and walls of constructed buildings, common areas, and most open ground. Examples of Solid Terrain include grass, concrete, stone, or metal. 

Solid Terrain has no mechanical benefits or deficits.

#### Shifting Terrain
Shifting Terrain can be walked upon at great difficulty at the risk of falling Prone. Shifting Terrain is typically a natural phenomenon, or as a simply constructed trap. Examples of Shifting Terrain include loose rocks, wet soil and sand, or slippery stone or metal.

When you run into Shifting Terrain, make an Acrobatics Skill Check. If the result is less than 12, you are forced Prone.

#### Difficult Terrain
Difficult Terrain can be walked upon or through at great effort. Difficult Terrain is a typically natural phenomenon. Examples of Difficult Terrain include thick bushes or 

#### Open Air
#### Flammable
#### Enflamed
#### Liquid
#### Freezable
#### Frozen
