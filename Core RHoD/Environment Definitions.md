# Preamble
All things are effected by their environment, your Characters especially so. 

### Rules for Environments
## Lighting
Lighting is generally a requirement for any creature to have confidence in their bodily actions. During Combat, Lighting can become a powerful weapon when used effectively.

If a space would be lit by multiple sources, it is considered lit by the brightest available light.

###### Blinding Light
Blinding Light is too much light, even through squinted eyes. Typically, Blinding Light is emitted by militaristic sources or intense natural sources.

While you are in a space lit by Blinging Light, you gain the 'Blinded' [[Ailment]] and you cannot be under the 'Hidden' [[Condition]] until you are no longer in a space lit by Blinging Light.

###### High Light
High Light is bright, but not blinding. High Light is emitted by sources like the sun, a campfire, or an electric or arcane lamp.

High Light has no mechanical benefits or deficits.

###### Low Light
Low Light enough Light to see generalities, but not details. Typically, Low Light is emitted by small sources, such as candles, or present at the edge of High Light.

While you are in a space lit by Low Light, you have Advantage on Stealth, Thievery, and Intimidation Skill Checks, and you have Disadvantage on Manipulation, Perception, and Investigation Skill Checks.

###### Darkness
Darkness is little to no light, where you cannot reasonably be certain of what you are seeing.

While you are in a space lit by Darkness, you have Advantage on Stealth, Thievery, and Intimidation Skill Checks, and you have Disadvantage on Manipulation, Perception, and Investigation Skill Checks. In addition, you impose Disadvantage on Attacks against you.
