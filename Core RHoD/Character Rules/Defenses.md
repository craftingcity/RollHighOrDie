# Preamble
A character's Defenses are the mechanical estimates of their ability to refuse or withstand damage from opponents using genuine harm against them.

## Reactive Defenses
Your three Reactive Defenses are the first line of defense against any harmful effect, including enemy attacks. These three are Reflex, Will, and Fortitude. 

These values are directly related to a character's [[Ability Scores]] and Combat [[Skills]].

#### Reflex
Your character's Reflex is their ability to completely out-maneuver a direct physical attack. 

Your Reflex is equal to 8, plus your Degree of Proficiency, plus your Dexterity or Intelligence Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

#### Fortitude
Your character's Fortitude is their ability to ignore and combat internal effects and changes.

Your Fortitude is equal to 8, plus your Degree of Proficiency, plus your Strength or Constitution Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

#### Will
Your character's Will is their ability to withstand harmful mental effects, natural, magical, or otherwise. 

Your Will is equal to 8, plus your Degree of Proficiency, plus your Wisdom or Charisma Modifier, whichever of the two is higher.

## Ablative Defenses
Your two Ablative Defenses are the final line of defense against harmful effects. When your Armoring and Vitality are reduced to zero, you will quickly become welcomed to your final rest.

#### Armoring
When you take damage, you will take the damage to your Armoring before your Vitality. Before you begin to reduce your Vitality, you must completely reduce your Armoring to 0.

If you take damage that would reduce your Armoring to less than 0, instead, it reduces it to 0 and you reduce your Vitality by the remaining amount.

Your character's Armoring will depend on your currently worn Equipment. 

#### Vitality & Wounds
When your Armoring has been reduced to 0, you will begin to take damage to your Vitality instead. Your Maximum Vitality is equal to your Constitution Score plus your Constitution Modifier or 1, whichever is greater.

`8 CON = 7 vit, 10 CON = 10 vit, 12 CON = 13 vit, 14`

When you take damage, if that damage would reduce your Vitality to a number less than 0, you take a Wound instead. When you take a Wound this way, expend a Hit Die and gain the number rolled plus your Constitution Modifier as Vitality.

If you would take damage that reduces your Vitality to less than 0 and that damage would reduce your Vitality beyond 0 by a value equal to half your Maximum Vitality, you die. 

When you have more Wounds than the value of your Constitution Modifier, at the beginning of your turn, and whenever you take another Wound, make a Death Call.

If you ever have a number of Wounds equal to your Constitution Score, you die.

###### Hit Die & Recovering Vitality
You have a number of Hit Die equal to half your Constitution Score. Unless otherwise stated, these Hit Die are d6's. 

While you are not in an Encounter, you may expend any number of Hit Die you have to regain missing Vitality. When you expend a Hit Die this way, gain the number rolled plus your Constitution Modifier as Vitality.

###### Resolving Wounds
During an Encounter, at the beginning of your turn, you may choose to make an Endurance Skill Check. If you do, you do not gain Action Points this turn. Then, if the result is 16 or greater, you resolve a Wound. If the result is 24 or greater, you resolve two Wounds instead.

While you are not in an Encounter, when you would regain any number of Hit Dice, for each Hit Die you would regain, you may choose to resolve a Wound instead. If you do, you do not regain that Hit Die.

###### Death Call
When you make a Death Call, you are as far from control as you can be, and you will grow farther from it as your character continues to die.

To make a Death Call, roll a d20. Do not add any modifiers or values.

If the die roll is 10 or greater, you succeed, and live for a moment longer.

If the die roll is 9 or fewer, you fail, and you gain a stack of the 'Exhausted' [[Condition]].

If the die roll is 1, you die.

###### Damage Resistance (DR)
Typed Damage Resistance is your resistance to harm caused by that Damage Type. True Damage Resistance is your resistance to any and all harm.

If you have both True and Typed Damage Resistance, apply your True Damage Resistance first, then your Typed Damage Resistance if applicable.

When you would take Damage, if you have Typed Damage Resistance of that Damage Type, you reduce the Damage you would take by your current Damage Resistance of that Damage Type.

When you would take any Damage, if you have True Damage Resistance, you reduce the Damage you would take by your current True Damage Resistance.

###### Damage Vulnerability (DV)
Typed Damage Vulnerability is your extra-vulnerability to harm caused by that Damage Type. True Damage Vulnerability is an extra-vulnerability to True Damage.

When you would take Damage, if you have Typed Damage Vulnerability of that Damage Type, you increase the Damage you would take by your current Damage Vulnerability of that Damage Type.

When you would take True Damage, if you have True Damage Vulnerability, you increase the Damage you would take by your current True Damage Vulnerability.

###### True Damage
> There are times a character will take damage despite the condition of their Armoring. This damage is known as True Damage. When a character takes True Damage, they treat their Armoring as 0 when taking that damage.
