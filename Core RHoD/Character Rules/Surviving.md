# Preamble
Much like our reality, in the world of RHoD, every character must maintain themselves with Food, Water, and Rest.

If a character fails to maintain these needs, they will begin to face compounding consequences. When these needs are completely met, a character will gain a bonus.

## Keeping Time
An adventurer's day is a generally a combination of Travel, Activity, and Rest. For the sake of your character's survival, RHoD cares for 4-hour periods of time known as Watches and 24-hour periods known as Days.

#### An Adventuring Day
With six Watches in a Day, a typical Adventuring Day begins at dawn with Travel. At some point, the party reaches their destination, and begins performing Activities. If they've stayed close to home, they might Travel again before Resting for the next 8-10 hours.

In total, that was 2 Travel Watches, 2 Active Watches, and 2 Resting Watches in the typical Adventuring Day.

## Food
We all must eat. If you do not eat, you do not physically have the energy you require to perform strenuous activity, or eventually even sustain your body.

When you are Travelling or Resting you may fulfill your character's need for Food. A Ration contains a full day's Food - three meals.

When a day passes, you will gain or lose conditions based on the amount of Food you've eaten;

- If you eat a Full Ration, you Chemically Resolve any number of stacks of 'Hungry' or 'Starving' [[Condition]] you have.
- If you eat a Half Ration, you gain a stack of the 'Hungry' [[Condition]], and you Chemically Resolve any number of stacks of the 'Starving' [[Condition]] you have.
- If you eat no Ration, you gain a stack of the 'Starving' [[Condition]].

## Water
Water is the base of life. When you do not drink, you will quickly experience the internal gnawing of dehydration.

When you are Travelling or Resting you may fulfill your character's need for Water.  A Ration contains a full day's Water - one gallon.

When a day passes, you will gain or lose conditions based on the amount of Water you've drank.

- If you drink a Full Ration, you Chemically Resolve any number of stacks of the 'Dehydrated' [[Condition]] you have.
- If you drink a Half Ration, you gain a stack of the 'Dehydrated' [[Condition]].
- If you drink no Ration, you gain three stacks of the 'Dehydrated' [[Condition]]. 

## Sleep
Sleep allows your body to perform the unconscious processes that will rejuvenate and recuperate your physical and mental health.

While you are Resting, you will fulfill your character's need for Sleep.

When a day passes, you will gain or lose conditions based on the amount of Sleep you've had.

- If you Rest for 8 or more hours, you lose one stack of the 'Exhausted' [[Condition]] or you gain the 'Well Rested' [[Condition]] if you have no 'Exhausted' stacks.
- If you Rest for more than 4 hours, but less than 8, you experience no mechanical benefit or detriment.
- If you Rest for less than 4 hours, you gain one stack of the 'Exhausted' [[Condition]].
