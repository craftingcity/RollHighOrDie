# Preamble
Ability Scores are the numerical representation of a character's base ability to enact their desires within or upon the world. There are six Ability Scores in RHoD, which can be split into physical scores - [[#Strength]], [[#Dexterity]], [[#Constitution]] - and mental scores - [[#Intelligence]], [[#Wisdom]], [[#Charisma]].

## Ability Checks
While a character's ability is tested, and the result is uncertain, they make an Ability Check. To make an Ability Check, roll a d20, and add the relevant Ability Modifier to the total. After you add any other benefits and deficits, compare your total to the Difficulty Class of the check.

#### Difficulty Class
The mechanical difficulty of a given task is known as its Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task is to succeed in, the higher the Difficulty Class of that task.

| Example                                       | DC  |
| --------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Very Easy (anyone can succeed)                | 5   |
| Easy (some training required)                 | 10  |
| Medium (professionals likely succeed)         | 15  |
| Hard (professionals likely fail)              | 20  |
| Very Hard (only the best succeed)             | 25  |
| Nearing Impossible (few if any could succeed) | 30  |
| Impossible (success is genre-shaking)         | 35  |

#### Advantage & Disadvantage
When you have Advantage on a roll, roll the die twice and take the **higher** roll.

When you have Disadvantage on a roll, roll the die twice and take the **lower** roll.
