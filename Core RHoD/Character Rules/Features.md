# Preamble
Features are the abilities that characters gain throughout their time under the spotlight of your game. Features are typically active abilities, and have Action Point requirements. A character's Features are their first and most direct avenue of versatility.

Some Features have Prerequisites that you must meet or surpass before you are eligible to take that feature.

For ease of presentation, Features are categorized by their "source of power" and requirements.

CORE
- [[Features - Martial]]
- [[Features - Communal]]

MAGIC EXPANSION
- [[Features - Arcane]]
- [[Features - Divine]]

#### Inherit and Replace
When one ability "inherits and replaces" another, the first ability gains all text, properties, and effects of the requirement ability, effectively acting as the requirement ability plus the new text of the first ability.

#### Ineligible to Gain
Unless otherwise stated, you may only ever gain a given Feature once.

Some Features are exclusive with other Features. A given Feature will list Features that, if you have gained, make you ineligible to gain that Feature.
