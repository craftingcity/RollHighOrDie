# Preamble
Traits are the inherent abilities, detriments, and lived experience of a character. Traits are typically passive abilities that have a trigger and an accompanying effect or change how the rules apply to a given character.

For ease of presentation, Traits are categorized by their "source of power" and their requirements.

#### Inherit and Replace
When one ability "inherits and replaces" another, the first ability gains all text, properties, and effects of the requirement ability, effectively acting as the requirement ability plus the new text of the first ability.
