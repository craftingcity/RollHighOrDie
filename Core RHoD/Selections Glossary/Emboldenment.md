# Preamble
Emboldenments are the positive effects imparted by one creature onto another. 

## Mundane Emboldenments
#### Aided
While you are 'Aided', when you make an Ability Check, the creature that granted you this Emboldenment makes the same Ability Check. You may take either result. Then, you Naturally Resolve a stack of this Emboldentment.

If you are ever more than 5' away from the creature that granted you this Emboldenment, you Manually Resolve this Emboldenment.

#### Pain Dulled
While you are 'Pain Dulled', when you take damage, you may reduce the amount of damage you take by one for each stack of 'Pain Dulled' you have. You cannot reduce the amount of damage you take to a value less than one. Then, you Naturally Resolve a stack of 'Pain Dulled'.

#### Regeneration
While you have 'Regeneration', at the beginning of your turn, roll a Hit Die, even if you have none, and do not expend it. You regain the number rolled as Vitality. Then, you Naturally Resolve a stack of 'Regeneration'.

#### Rallied
While you are 'Rallied', when you next make an Attack Roll, you have advantage on that Attack. Then, you Naturally Resolve this Emboldentment.
