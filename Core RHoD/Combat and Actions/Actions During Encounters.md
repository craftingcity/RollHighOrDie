# Preamble
When you find yourself in a situation that you recognize as dangerous, your body begins to pump adrenaline through your veins. As you begin to consciously analyze your surroundings, your body will prepare itself for immediate action and reaction.

In our game of RHoD, your character will find themselves in dangerous situations commonly. During a time when your character's mortal life could be threatened, or you are entering a hazardous space, your Referee may [[#Call for Initiative]], and begin to section time into [[#Round]]s. This portion of our game is known as an *Encounter*.

During each [[#Round]], you will take [[#Actions]] as your character in an attempt to complete your goal or otherwise resolve the *Encounter*.

## Timing During Initiative
##### Call for Initiative
`` call for init at top of round would likely slow combat, but is interesting...``
When *Initiative* is called, you will make a Dexterity Ability Check. This represents numerically when your character will act when compared to others during the *Encounter*.

##### Round
Throughout RHoD, time is measured in different ways. A [[#Round]] is six seconds. It likely took you more than a few [[#Round]]s to read this page, let alone this chapter.

During each [[#Round]] of *Initiative*, each character in the scene is restricted to a six second window of time during which they will take a number of mechanical [[#Actions]].

## Actions
Actions, mechanically, are the [[Features]], [[Traits]], or [[Generic Actions]] a character uses during their turn. A character spends Action Points (AP) to take those actions. 

During *Initiative*, at the beginning of a character's turn, they gain a number of Action Points equal to half their Dexterity Score. A character may take as many [[#Actions]] as they can pay for on their turn.

At the End of a character's turn, any remaining Action Points are lost. A character may not spend Action Points during another character's turn.

## Situational Actions
When the Action you want to take is not described in mechanical text, talk with your Referee. Together, you can
